Visual terms &amp; conditions and privacy statement icons

Have you ever once read the Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy for a website, application, or device? 
Have you aggreed to them?

These long and difficult to read documents that we agree to without a second thought are a legal contract between you and the company. For some reason we treat these documents differently than other contracts that we sign (and give more thought to).

Visual Terms is a set of icons that can be used to represent key aspects of terms and conditions. These are not meant to be a substitute to aggreeing to the full terms, rather a way to get the key points at-a-glance before. Visual Terms acts much like Creative Commons Licenses. There are standarized icons that are defined in a central, accessable place (e.g. a website).

While there is no way that icons can accurately represent a full Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy document, they give the company an oportunity to be transparent and communicate the key points to those users who are not willing to give the document a quick scan before rushing to click the "Accept" button.
